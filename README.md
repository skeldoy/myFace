## Pebble Time Round Clock-Face

Inspired by the Hercules-graphics from my childhood - this clock face is "what I need" on the Pebble Time Round.
It gives you the date, the week number, the day, time in hours and minutes, which day of the year it is and stats about battery levels and bluetooth connectivity. All served in the slick style of Hercules-graphics.

The face is based on the example-code so it's not going to look revolutionary if you've seen pebble code before.
I was thinking about doing it in just three-text-layers, but I don't know how it's going to evolve so I'd rather keep the code-layout I have and clean it up with packing it in defines and macros before I start chucking away code.

If someone got any pointers to what this clock-face might be missing in terms of functionality - gimme a hollar - also if there are bugs (meh)..

Feel free to play around with this if you like my plan - retro computing clock faces - 4TW!
